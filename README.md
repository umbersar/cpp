# Description

Code overview:
1. https://github.com/umbersar/cpp/tree/master/dotNetNumerical contains [Numerical_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) code in witten in C. Nothing ground breaking or exciting but mostly for my own understanding. 
2. https://github.com/umbersar/cpp/tree/master/cuda shows how to integrate code written in Python with C code for getting performance benefits. It is also a demonstration of [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) widely used in HPC world to speed up scientific simulations.
