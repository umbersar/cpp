1)double not supported..So code is using floats. I think the python float is mapped to c double...so running cuda on my laptopm to integrate with python won't work as my laptop is only single precision in GPU.
2) to use printf in device functions(GPU functions or methods),  set "code generation" property of "Device" under "CUDA C/C++" from compute_10,sm_10 to compute_20, sm_20
(VS2010 I changed Project->{Project Name} Properties->CUDA C/C++ ->Device -> [Code Generation]: compute_10, sm_10 to compute_20, sm_20 and it worked)
